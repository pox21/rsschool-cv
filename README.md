### Briefly About Myself:

Working as a dental technician as a specialist, I did not find satisfaction in this profession.<br>
Looking for a hobby that would bring me pleasure, I stumbled upon html, css...<br>
So I started to dive into the field of web development,<br>
and now my life is code. I live in code and development.<br>

I know that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.<br>
